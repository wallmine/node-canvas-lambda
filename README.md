# node-canvas-lambda

*Note:* 
If you're not using Node.js version 12 then you'll need to recompile the layers.
See the Build section below. Also, these layers include chart.js. If you don't
want these modules included you can remove them from the Dockerfile (around line
19) and rebuild the layers.

1.  Log into AWS console and navigate to Lambda service
1.  Click **Layers** in the sidebar
1.  Click **Create layer**
1.  Give the layer a name, description and upload the `node12_canvas_layer.zip`
1.  Click **Create**
1.  Follow the previous 3 steps and create a layer for `node12_canvas-lib64-layer.zip`
1.  Click **Functions** in the sidebar
1.  Select your function in the function list
1.  Click **Layers** in the Designer panel
1.  In the Layers panel click **Add a layer**.

Name and Version and click **Add**.

### AWS CLI

```zsh

aws lambda publish-layer-version \
